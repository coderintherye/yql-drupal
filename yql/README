Welcome to the Yahoo Query Language (YQL) API Module

Module Creator: nowarninglabel <http://drupal.org/user/297478>

The YQL API Module only provides a block to test YQL Queries on its own.
It is mainly intended as a launch point for I and other developers to 
create plugin modules that harness the YQL API. 

An working example module is included with this package, yql_autotagging.
The YQL autotagging module harnesses the power of the YQL API to provide
term suggestions to the autotagging (http://drupal.org/project/autotagging)
module. In this way, nodes can have taxonomy terms created automatically
based on contextual analysis of their contents.

In order to use these modules, you will first need to enable them as usual.
For instance, go to Site Building -> Modules and check the boxes for these
two modules.
